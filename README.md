# My Guide to Solo Camping in Iceland ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¸

Doing a solo camping trip in Iceland is a brilliant idea if you are a person (especially a woman) that has been interested in tackling traveling or camping alone. Iceland is relatively safe & if you have a driver's license and not scared of driving on some gravel roads or one-lane bridges, it's a beautiful country to explore. âœ¨

## Pre-trip planning:

### How did I choose a camper rental?

Honestly, I didn't plan my trip planning to rent a camper van. I was thinking about staying in Reykjavik & take some tours out from there, then I decided I wanted to do the ring road around Iceland and looked at tour buses (ridiculously expensive), then getting a rental car & renting hotel rooms, then landed on getting a camper van since would probably be the most flexible option & honestly the most affordable for me traveling solo. 

I rented my camper from [Happy Campers](https://happycampers.is/) after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE1PQPCYbGg) of a woman solo camping in Iceland using their van. I felt like if it worked for her, it would work for me! There office is close to Keflavik International Airport & they offer a shuttle pickup from the airport every hour.

Of course, I checked out other camper rentals, but felt the Happer Camper setup for the [smallest van (Happy 1 Auto)](https://happycampers.is/camper/happy-1-auto/) (built-in "kitchen" with sink & fridge, foldup bed/couch, usb ports in the back of the van, heater!) & that wifi is included in the rental was a great deal. The final thing thing that won me over was that I could get it with an automatic transmission!

As you can see in my video above, I really fell in love with this little VW Caddy. (I named him Karl the camper, btw) It was easy to drive and as long as I didn't go on too rough of a gravel road (some campsite roads are brutal ðŸ˜…) the 2WD little chariot was a dream to drive & live in for a week!

### How did I plan my itinerary?

Honestly figuring out my route was my biggest stress going into the trip. I knew I wanted do a clockwise loop around the island and hit several geothermal baths & see cool land formations. I basically focused on main tourist sites in [this google map I created](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1YV8FF4ZWxXEUkmTUc94H3E1EFlFTJ6ov&usp=sharing) & then cross-referenced with these campsite google maps:

- [Happy Campers Campsite Guide](https://www.google.de/maps/@64.9072787,-21.9859533,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!6m1!1s1wk_t105qo4BYqaBL7xTcLUz5uXQ)
- [Campsite of Iceland](https://www.google.de/maps/@64.6605078,-24.8965918,5z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!6m1!1s1gJV0ZEEDYENMWKp4hvMoeEpDQycW9IHd)

I estimated I would be ok driving 4-5 hours a day to be able to complete the trip in 7 days and that's how I initially planned what campsites would stay at.

During the trip, I spent a lot of time checking the google reviews and photos of different campsite to make sure it felt like I would like the scenery & would hopefully not be too busy cuz of too many amenities. I actually ended up preferring the more primitive campsites that only offered toilets & perhaps an outdoor sink since they were less populated with families & kids.
