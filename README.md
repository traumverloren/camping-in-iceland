# My Guide to Solo Camping in Iceland üáÆüá∏

Doing a solo camping trip in Iceland is a brilliant idea if you are a person (especially a woman) that has been interested in tackling traveling or camping alone. Iceland is relatively safe & if you have a driver's license and not scared of driving on some gravel roads or one-lane bridges, it's a beautiful country to explore. ‚ú®

## Pre-trip planning:

### How did I choose a camper rental?

Honestly, I didn't plan my trip planning to rent a camper van. I was thinking about staying in Reykjavik & take some tours out from there, then I decided I wanted to do the ring road around Iceland and looked at tour buses (ridiculously expensive), then getting a rental car & renting hotel rooms, then landed on getting a camper van since would probably be the most flexible option & honestly the most affordable for me traveling solo. 

I rented my camper from [Happy Campers](https://happycampers.is/) after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE1PQPCYbGg) of a woman solo camping in Iceland using their van. I felt like if it worked for her, it would work for me! There office is close to Keflavik International Airport & they offer a shuttle pickup from the airport every hour.

Of course, I checked out other camper rentals, but felt the Happer Camper setup for the [smallest van (Happy 1 Auto)](https://happycampers.is/camper/happy-1-auto/) (built-in "kitchen" with sink & fridge, foldup bed/couch, usb ports in the back of the van, heater!) & that wifi is included in the rental was a great deal. The final thing thing that won me over was that I could get it with an automatic transmission!

As you can see in my video above, I really fell in love with this little VW Caddy. (I named him Karl the camper, btw) It was easy to drive and as long as I didn't go on too rough of a gravel road (some campsite roads are brutal üòÖ) the 2WD little chariot was a dream to drive & live in for a week!

### How did I plan my itinerary?

Honestly figuring out my route was my biggest stress going into the trip. I knew I wanted do a clockwise loop around the island and hit several geothermal baths & see cool land formations. I basically focused on main tourist sites in [this google map I created](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1YV8FF4ZWxXEUkmTUc94H3E1EFlFTJ6ov&usp=sharing) & then cross-referenced with these campsite google maps:

- [Happy Campers Campsite Guide](https://www.google.de/maps/@64.9072787,-21.9859533,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!6m1!1s1wk_t105qo4BYqaBL7xTcLUz5uXQ)
- [Campsite of Iceland](https://www.google.de/maps/@64.6605078,-24.8965918,5z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!6m1!1s1gJV0ZEEDYENMWKp4hvMoeEpDQycW9IHd)

I estimated I would be ok driving 4-5 hours a day to be able to complete the trip in 7 days and that's how I initially planned what campsites would stay at.

During the trip, I spent a lot of time checking the google reviews and photos of different campsites to make sure it felt like I would like the scenery & would hopefully not be too busy because they offerred many amenities (kitchen, showers, washing machines, etc). I actually ended up preferring the more primitive campsites that only offered toilets & perhaps an outdoor sink since they were less populated with families & kids.

### What did I pack?

I only packed a [Tom Bihn Aeronaut 45](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/travel-bags/products/aeronaut-45?variant=16037975719999) carry-on bag & my trusty Fj√§llr√§ven k√•nken backpack. I knew the camper would be light on storage for my large hardcase Rimowa checked luggage, but honestly I was completely freaked out about the time it might take to get through the covid-19 checks at the Arrivals at Keflavik airport after reading this [article](https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2021/08/09/passengers_arriving_in_iceland_stuck_in_line_for_ho/). I was arriving at 14:30 & needed to pick up my camper by 16:30 & was concerned about making it out of the airport in time. So I planned for carry-on only & even paid & booked a first row seat on the plane. This turned out to be unnecessary as there was no line of course for me when I arrived. üôÉ

I knew the temps would be cool but not unbearable, especially since I love cooler weather, so it was necessary to bring alot of items for layering, plus I'm ok with washing underwear and shirts in the sink and letting them dry to save luggage space.
