# My Guide to Solo Camping in Iceland üáÆüá∏

Doing a solo camping trip in Iceland is a brilliant idea if you are a person (especially a woman) that has been interested in tackling traveling or camping alone. Iceland is relatively safe & if you have a driver's license and not scared of driving on some gravel roads or one-lane bridges, it's a beautiful country to explore. ‚ú®

**Total driving distance: 2100km in ~8 days**

During the entire trip I listened to [Low Roar](http://www.lowroarmusic.com/)'s album, [0](https://open.spotify.com/album/4G3ZBFg8MpTSDxDQ3m2BCb) on repeat.  It was recorded in Reykjav√≠k and the iconic Japanese video game creator, Hideo Kojima, heard Low Roar‚Äôs 0 playing while visiting a record store in Reykjav√≠k and became obsessed and listened to it on repeat daily. Two of the songs are on the soundtrack for Death Stranding. I'm completely obsessed with the song ["Please don't stop (Chapter 1)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h232B2wjE2s).

## Pre-trip planning:

### How did I choose a camper rental?


![A picnic spot on the Southeast coast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132061841-a5331e61-aafb-49d4-9bdb-8306ff2a2cfd.jpg)

Honestly, I didn't plan my trip planning to rent a camper van. I was thinking about staying in Reykjavik & take some tours out from there, then I decided I wanted to do the ring road around Iceland and looked at tour buses (ridiculously expensive), then getting a rental car & renting hotel rooms, then landed on getting a camper van since would probably be the most flexible option & honestly the most affordable for me traveling solo. 

I rented my camper from [Happy Campers](https://happycampers.is/) after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE1PQPCYbGg) of a woman solo camping in Iceland using their van. I felt like if it worked for her, it would work for me! There office is close to Keflavik International Airport & they offer a shuttle pickup from the airport every hour.

I ended up choosing their [Happiest bundle](https://happycampers.is/campers/extras/) at an extra 60 euros/day to have the full insurance (including gravel/rock damage) coverage (& complete peace of mind) & any of their extras I'd like for the camper. I ended up adding a bluetooth portable speaker (was a great idea!), camp chair, camp table, & an extra sleeping bag to my camper.

![My favorite gravel road, Route 54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/131900639-5db483dd-d396-4679-a518-59831edb6a88.jpg)
![Camping on the very north of Iceland](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/131902711-1fd1f8b1-abbf-430b-9ed4-cf8c52c4aa43.jpg)


Of course, I checked out other camper rentals, but felt the Happer Camper setup for the [smallest van (Happy 1 Auto)](https://happycampers.is/camper/happy-1-auto/) (built-in "kitchen" with sink & fridge, foldup bed/couch, usb ports in the back of the van, heater!) & that wifi/gps is included in the rental was a great deal. The final thing that won me over was that I could get it with an automatic transmission!

![Inside of camper with bed unfolded with ipad playing Downton Abbey](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132061988-5468662a-64fa-439b-b50e-e3a4f1c3227c.jpg)

It is advertised as a 1-2 person camper. If you are planning to rent a small camper van like this for 2 people, beware that it is going to be cozy sleeping together & limited storage for 2 people in the van. Make sure you like spending a lot of close time together beforehand üòÖ. I felt it was great for one person though. I spent my evenings drinking hot chocolate and watching downton abbey on my ipad in bed as shown above . üôÉ

As you can see in my video above, I really fell in love with this little VW Caddy. (I named him Karl the camper, btw) It was easy to drive and as long as I didn't go on too rough of a gravel road (some campsite roads are brutal üòÖ) the 2WD little chariot was a dream to drive & live in for a week!

### How did I plan my itinerary?

Honestly figuring out my route was my biggest stress going into the trip. I knew I wanted do a clockwise loop around the island and hit several geothermal baths & see cool land formations. I basically focused on main tourist sites in [this google map I created](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1YV8FF4ZWxXEUkmTUc94H3E1EFlFTJ6ov&usp=sharing) & then cross-referenced with these campsite google maps:

- [Happy Campers Campsite Guide](https://www.google.de/maps/@64.9072787,-21.9859533,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!6m1!1s1wk_t105qo4BYqaBL7xTcLUz5uXQ)
- [Campsite of Iceland](https://www.google.de/maps/@64.6605078,-24.8965918,5z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!6m1!1s1gJV0ZEEDYENMWKp4hvMoeEpDQycW9IHd)

I estimated I would be ok driving 4-5 hours a day to be able to complete the trip in 7 days and that's how I initially planned what campsites would stay at.


![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132043692-315a957f-2658-4191-9bbd-4b21bc32e272.jpg)
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132043717-130ec065-0ddf-44e7-8f36-74e5da255db2.jpg)


During the trip, I spent a lot of time checking the google reviews and photos of different campsites to make sure it felt like I would like the scenery & would hopefully not be too busy because they offerred many amenities (kitchen, showers, washing machines, etc). I actually ended up preferring the more primitive campsites that only offered toilets & perhaps an outdoor sink since they were less populated with families & kids.

---

### What did I pack?

I only packed a [Tom Bihn Aeronaut 45](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/travel-bags/products/aeronaut-45?variant=16037975719999) carry-on bag & my trusty Fj√§llr√§ven k√•nken backpack. I knew the camper would be light on storage for my large hardcase Rimowa checked luggage... But the real reason for carry-on only was that I was completely freaked out about the time it might take to get through the covid-19 checks at the Arrivals at Keflavik airport after reading this [article](https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2021/08/09/passengers_arriving_in_iceland_stuck_in_line_for_ho/). I was arriving at 14:30 & needed to pick up my camper by 16:30 & was concerned about making it out of the airport in time. So I planned for carry-on only & even paid & booked a first row seat on the plane. This turned out to be unnecessary as there was no line of course when I arrived. üôÉ

I knew the temps would be cool but not unbearable, especially since I love cooler weather, so it was not necessary for me to bring a lot of items for layering. Also, I'm ok with washing underwear and shirts in the sink and letting them dry to rewear in order to save luggage space.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132045385-612e855b-042e-4e9a-a00a-33372d110383.JPEG)

**The most important non-clothing items I brought were my coffee making supplies! I'm a coffee enthusiast ‚òï & daydreamed heavily about the moment each morning where I would prepare an aeropress coffee in the camper üòç.**

#### Pack list:

- Coffee stuff:
  - Aeropress
  - Scoop
  - Comandante grinder
  - Snow peak titanium 450 mug
  - Bonanza coffee beans
- Art stuff:
  - Watercolor palette
  - Sketchbook

  - SD to USB-C adapter
  - Ipad
  - Instax camera
  - Gorilla tripod + smartphone adapter
- Snacks:
  - 3 packs of vegan jerky
  - Ritter sport pfefferminz

  - Couple t-shirts
  - Couple pairs of socks
  - Ripped jeans

  - Eyebrow powder
  - Mascara
  - Deodorant
  - Sprekenhus Amber Infatuation travel perfume (I'm super extra what can I say? üíÖ)


In retrospect, I hesitated & didn't pack a couple items that I would NOT forget the next time. They were:

- Headlamp (for trips to bathroom in the night!)
- Nail glue (I have long beautiful natural nails, and the camping & hot bath soaks were brutal on my nails & I split a nail at end of the trip & paid heavily to find nail glue in a pharmacy to repair it!)
- Suncreen (for the sun in the northern part of the island!)
- AUX cable & iphone headphone adapter (The touchscreen of the infotainment system of the VW Caddy was unresponsive so I could not use BT to stream music & ended up driving all 7 days in silence üòß)

### How does camping work in Iceland?

It is extremely illegal to camp outside of a campground in Iceland. Do not do this!

No reason or real way to book ahead, there will be spots available. Fees ranged from free (donation encouraged) to 20 euros. Most I stayed at were around 8 euros/night. You basically pick a spot & that's it really. You either pay when you arrive at a reception area or if no one is there, someone will show up in the morning & knock on your camper. Everywhere accepted card/contactless payments. If you need to pay for a washing machine or shower, be prepared with some coins.

My camper van came with a large water reservoir container that was hooked up to the sink and functioned as my drinking water during the trip. Most campgrounds have an outdoor faucet with hose that you can use to refill your water reservoir.

## My completed itinerary

![Cute map of iceland showing roughly my driving route for each of the 8 days I had the camper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132092660-2e05531f-7255-432e-b137-7cd825621121.jpg)


### Day 1: Arrival

- Picked up the camper van
- Went to the nearest Kronan & bought groceries. I opted to mainly eat sandwiches during the trip to minimize how much different food I bought. I "splurged" on Honey Nut Cheerios & Swiss Miss hot cocoa as I miss this stuff from the US. The only thing I really cooked during the trip was eggs.

![IMG_3375](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132093302-c6f76302-3732-4412-9c1e-8ee80ef6ff0f.jpg)

- Drove **2 hours (150km)** to my first campground, [Snorrasta√∞ir Farm](https://snorrastadir.is/) in Borgarnes.

![IMG_3383](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132093315-c186b4c9-3db0-49a7-995a-9d403cdaf871.jpg)

- This campground was the priciest of the entire trip at ~20 euros. But, it had great facilities (Huge indoor kitchen/dining area, hot private showers) & I could pay at the reception upon arrival. It wasn't busy so it was a great first night camping experience.

![IMG_3385](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132093325-be28cbd1-9d73-4349-bbf1-42c32ce5e6bf.jpg)

- Total driving time for Day 1 was **2 hours (150 km)**.


### Day 2: Sn√¶fellsnes Peninsula

- Drove around the entire Sn√¶fellsnes Peninsula
- Stopped at [B√∫√∞akirkja](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/budakirkja), [Gatklettur](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/gatklettur), [Kirkjufellsfoss](https://guidetoiceland.is/connect-with-locals/regina/mt-kirkjufell-kirkjufellsfoss-in-grundarfjoerdur-the-most-popular-mountain-on-the-snaefellsnes-peninsula)

![IMG_3428](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132095154-76c89769-c085-4241-ae79-f297087f19e7.jpg)

![IMG_3434](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132095158-0645841c-91e0-4ae4-8fd0-8c94bc89faed.jpg)
![IMG_3449](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132095168-790bf33d-26bc-47a4-ae8b-8f3e574ac146.JPG)
![IMG_3461](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132095171-a7453f02-5af9-4fd3-9432-1081403d29af.jpg)


- Accidently drove past some beaches I wanted to stop at, but kept going forward.

![IMG_3493](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132095296-05791779-2465-4fec-a342-dbe75c5be910.jpg)


- One of my favorite parts of the trip was taking **Rte 54** which is a rougher dirt road between the peninsula and Northwest Iceland. It loops around the fjords & is fairly desolate with very little traffic. It was marvelous. I stopped at a picnic pullover & watercolored in my travel journal for a while. It was windy, cool & moody. I love it.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/131901170-5d0b9bb9-b2aa-450f-8a9f-13230ab0290d.JPG)


- I drove to the [Illugastadir Campground](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/illugastadir-1) on the northwestern coast for Night 2. It is a seal viewing spot and the site has a dramatic backstory of jilted lovers stabbing & burning a man in the house on the site. The murderers were beheaded & their heads put on stakes. It was the last public execution in Iceland.

![IMG_3571](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132095763-c14452f5-8fdc-4445-aba4-aab9ee096fbb.jpg)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132095983-fa368796-526a-4e15-bd91-2e6c13661755.mov



- It was a primitive (only 2 toilets & an outdoor sink) and quiet campground with only a few other campers there overnight. There was no office to pay at, but a nice lady showed up in the morning at the main house & walked over to my camper in the morning so I could pay. This was my favorite campground of the entire trip and would 10000% go back to stay 1-2 more nights.

![IMG_3523](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132097389-e5ac31b2-a3fc-46cd-9628-01f5c9ddcc79.jpg)

- Total driving time for Day 2 was **5 hours (360 km)**.

### Day 3: Northern Iceland & H√∫sav√≠k

- It was amazing to wake up at this campground with the view of the sea and have my morning coffee.

![IMG_3561](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132095876-3ea591e1-eebf-4baa-a6aa-f96ce257cdd1.jpg)
![IMG_3604](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132133583-15501050-d69e-40d0-8337-9f17f53245b0.JPG)


- Drove to see [Hvitserkur](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/hvitserkur) rock formation off the coast nearby. It is beautiful! It was even possible to scramble down the rocks to the beach, but I did not take this risk since I was alone. It was dreamy to look at. The entire route to Illugastadir & Hvitserkur is a gravel road with lots of sheep to look out for. 


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132131460-4c87fc02-963b-4f24-9a0e-18e3484ae742.mp4

- Drove a long stretch through northern Iceland to make it to Akureyri. The landscapes are serene and it was an easy drive on paved Rte 1. This is the second largest city in Iceland. 


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132131510-ba5b3620-0223-4c48-b9e5-c5404b4ab246.mp4

- I stopped in Akureyri for fuel top-up & few groceries (fresh veg & bananas & found bonus cheetos :heart_eyes:)
- To keep driving east from here, there's a toll [tunnel](tunnel.is) that you need to pay online within 3 hours prior or after driving through it! It's the only toll like this in Iceland, so don't forget to pay it!

![IMG_3618](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132131563-8ae42081-6f91-4c49-9f42-cd9a0613e958.jpg)

- I drove to [Go√∞afoss](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/godafoss), which is a beautiful waterfall right on Rte 1. While I was there I watch 3 brave kayakers go over it successfully! It was really fun to watch them.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132131587-b990ecc8-bf53-4bc3-8ddb-253edec801e3.mp4

- I now headed north to H√∫sav√≠k, which is internationally known as a great place to go whalewatching. It was also popularized by the comedy film, [Eurovision Song Contest: The Saga of Fire Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjuphuG3ndw) starring Will Ferrell. It's a real place! :) I stopped in town to visit the first thermal baths of my trip.
- [Geosea](https://www.geosea.is/) is a thermal seawater bath. In the middle of the last century, hot water was drilled at H√∫sav√≠kurh√∂f√∞i. There was a hot, mineral-rich sea that was not suitable for space heating but turned out to be ideal for bathing. The bathing pools are located on a cliff and offer an infinity pool experience. It was beautiful to soak and look out on the sea and look for any whales (I didn't see any). The water was very warm. It was the warmest bath I visited the entire trip. It felt more like a hot pot! I had to constantly sit out of the water as I was getting too hot!


![IMG_0118](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132131880-b13122c1-d0ea-4ea7-bbf3-3970e7ae305a.jpg)
![IMG_3661](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132131883-4faaf1ed-6a60-46dd-bc16-4133cf4d3ddf.JPG)


- After I soaked and then took a nice shower there, I drove up to [Camping 66.12](https://www.facebook.com/camping66.12) to camp overnight. It is located at the top of the fjord and is a beautiful (but slightly popular) campground. It's easy to see why it's popular, I could camp directly on the sea. The campground also had a kitchen, washing machines, showers and indoor bathrooms. The host was super friendly & he took the camping fee on arrival.

![IMG_3650](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132131905-c6a095a0-a6ec-4cb7-8ff3-13ebf5728b53.JPG)

- Total driving time for Day 3 was **4.5 hours (333 km)**.

### Day 4: M√Ωvatn & Eastern Iceland 

- Woke up and made coffee in one of the most beautiful spots in Iceland overlooking the Greenland Sea :)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132133315-888a36b0-1ed2-45e3-a96b-2848f4a15e2e.mp4


- Drove to Lake M√Ωvatn and stopped at Sk√∫tusta√∞ag√≠gar, H√∂f√∞i, Grj√≥tagj√°... Skipped some other sites here like hiking up to edge of Hverfjall crater. There were large amounts of flying bugs (so much that hikers were wearing netted hats) that I skipped some things I had bookmarked.

![IMG_3678](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132984573-364f240d-ca01-4951-863a-13a503ea7700.JPG)
![IMG_3684](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132984575-ead3ca5e-a366-49bb-a046-37a2e1230cd6.JPG)

- Highlight of the day was soaking at [M√Ωvatn baths](https://myvatnnaturebaths.is/?lang=enhttps://myvatnnaturebaths.is/?lang=en). The baths have fantastic views of Lake M√Ωvatn & Hverfjall and the soft light blue colored mineral rich water. Beware a lot of bus tour groups stop here so it was quite busy when I went. But the bonus to this was there was a group of boomer women from Texas that showed up and were loud and colorful and taking lots of selfies of each other while giving tips on how to take hotter selfies (best chin angles, using another app to retouch wrinkles :D) and it was super fun to eavesdrop them & literally lol from it :).

![IMG_4447 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132985676-02951bf4-cfa6-4e04-ac85-81e97f79260f.jpg)


- After the baths, I drove A LOT. I again skipped some things - Krafla crater & Dettifoss waterfall. It was buggy & raining intermittently & I was worried about driving a long distance to the southeastern part of Iceland to camp for the night so I opted to skip them.

![IMG_3693](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132984968-a2a660dd-cbc2-4818-8193-f36dde8c8434.JPG)

- I camped at [Fossardalur Campsite](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Fossardalur+Campsite/@64.7557916,-14.5007767,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!3m7!1s0x48cec00df46e3e31:0xd42bda8a82eae65d!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d64.7557916!4d-14.498588) in the southeast. Wonderful campsite with friendly host and wifi (needed it as mobile service was shit). But it was quite busy with families since it has indoor bathrooms and showers.

- Total driving time for Day 4 was **5 hours (390 km)**.

### Day 5: Southern Iceland

- This was my longest & most tiresome driving day. I felt the pressure of my driving days coming to a close in a couple of days and I wanted to plan for a last minute decision to go snorkeling at Silfra on the 7th day, so I knew I had to get a big chunk of driving done today. In retrospect, this section of Iceland is gorgeous with black sand beaches and waterfalls to expore & I ended up skipping some sights I wanted to see. üò≠ Definitely plan to come back here with several days to slowly explore this area in the future.

- The drive started out super sunny! I skipped [Dj√∫pavogsk√∂rin Natural Geothermal Pool](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dj%C3%BApavogsk%C3%B6rin+Natural+Geothermal+Pool/@64.6539378,-14.3434785,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48cec304bc744d6b:0xc0e2cd45ef94cb2e!8m2!3d64.6539378!4d-14.3412898?hl=en-US) that was nearby my campsite to see other sites. Would have stopped here if I had time. :(
- I approached a looming fog. I went through a mountain tunnel at Vestrahorn Mountain & ended up in dense fog on the other side! I was going to visit the beach at [Stokksnes](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/stokksnes) but was deterred that I'd much out of it in the fog, so kept going.

- Next stop was [J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Glacier Lagoon](https://www.livefromiceland.is/webcams/jokulsarlon/) & Diamond Beach. WOW. I could spend hours here immersed in the natural beauty.

- I felt like I was walking into a fantasy world when I stepped onto a misty moody Diamond Beach with gorgeous giant glowing blue glacier chunks scattered on the black sands. Truly one of the most ‚ú® magical ‚ú® experiences with nature in my life.

- I accidently drove past a beautiful winding canyon, [Fja√∞r√°rglj√∫fur](https://goo.gl/maps/sYTizUZ3sgSQhpFi9), I wanted to see. Oops ü§¶.
- I stopped in Vik to get a nice coffee and some beans to take home with me at [Skool Beans](https://g.page/Skoolbeans). It's a cute little coffee spot inside a yellow school bus.

![IMG_3789](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/133138440-79b05714-2e9e-4564-bd76-3ed922a6cc2e.JPG)

- Right outside of Vik is [Reynisfjara Beach](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/reynisfjara) with black sands and towering basalt rock. It's very important to not turn your back on the waves here, people have been swept off their feet by the brutal waves and killed.

- I completely blanked out again when driving and drove past the Black Sand Beach & [S√≥lheimasandur Plane Wreckage](https://goo.gl/maps/6edTgi6CdH8pJ4VN7)! ü§¶ Ugh!
- Stopped at beautiful [Sk√≥gafoss Waterfall](https://guidetoiceland.is/connect-with-locals/regina/the-beautiful-skogafoss-waterfall-and-the-legend-of-the-treasure-chest).

![IMG_3801](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/133139682-dec2e8ac-eb98-4f31-8d42-bd881cc7bcfe.JPG)

- Finally ended up camping at the deserted [√Ålfaskei√∞ campground](https://goo.gl/maps/6sNx75sieDZ5CUjN8) near Fl√∫√∞ir. It was a bit sketchy to drive up the entrance with my little 2WD camper and I had a moment where I thought I might have gotten the camper stuck, but it ended up being a super quiet and pastoral setting for camping. I was exhausted and crashed hard this night. This campground is a primitive campsite with only cold water & toilets.

- Total driving time for Day 5 was **7 hours (530 km)**.


### Day 6: Golden Circle & Secret Lagoon

- Didn't make coffee at the campsite as I was anxious about getting the camper out of the campsite without getting stuck üòÖ
- Drove to see the majestic [Gullfoss Waterfall](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/gullfoss)


![IMG_3829](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/133312864-8528a7f3-448e-4312-a611-ebfd2a991b27.JPG)

- Drove to see the [Geysir](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/geysir) erupt.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/133303326-49853d32-3860-4b0f-a671-789879bf0892.mp4

- Spent my afternoon relaxing at the super chill [Secret Lagoon](https://secretlagoon.is/). It wasn't busy and was so nice to relax in the water, then take a nice hot shower after camping.

- Drove to [Kerid crater](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kerid-crater-lake) and hiked down to the bottom of the crater where it is eerily quiet & protected from the wind at the top.

- Drove to [Thingvellir National Park](https://guidetoiceland.is/connect-with-locals/jorunnsg/ingvellir-national-park) & camped here overnight since it's only a few minutes from Silfra where I would be snorkeling the next day! Thingvellir an incredibly important site for Icelandic history, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the tectonic plates of Eurasia & North American meet (and are slowly drifting apart).

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/133311892-0b3117e6-fd80-4ad3-8f62-7f9b7f5186e8.mov

- Total driving time for Day 6 was **~2.5 hours (180 km)**.


### Day 7: Snorkeling at Silfra

- Stopped at üåà [√ñxar√°rfoss Waterfall](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/oxararfoss), which was just a few minutes from my campsite. If you visit in the morning and it's sunny, you will be treated to a rainbow üåà like I was!

![IMG_3937](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/133316386-5286438b-012b-44f7-b577-c4afbce7e281.JPG)

- Highlight of the day was snorkeling at between the tectonic plates of Eurasia & North America at Silfra! It's the only place like this in the world. The water was crystal clear but freezing. I suited up in a drysuit but my lips were completely exposed! It was one of the coolest tours I've ever done. I booked through [Troll Expeditions](https://troll.is/tour/snorkel-between-continents-in-silfra-free-underwater-photos-small-group/) and would 100% recommend the experience. I felt safe & had a great time and got lots of gopro photos taken by our tour guide during the snorkel.

- I drove to my last campground of the trip on the southeastern coast, [GATA Free camping](https://goo.gl/maps/UbhHixYuXZFK79R97). This is one of the few free campground in Iceland (though donations strongly recommended -- I left 1000 kroner in the donation box). It was super windy (55km/hr winds) and rainy. I cooked my last supper & drank hot cocoa & watched Downton Abbey in the camper. ‚ú®

- Total driving time for Day 7 was **~1.5 hours (100 km)**.


### Day 8: Blue Lagoon

- It's my last day and I was emotional about my camping trip coming to an end since it had been the most magical 8 days by myself in my life.
- I made coffee in the camper and then drove to the famous Blue Lagoon. 

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/133317355-9504b89a-2c6f-4735-89d4-23107af9a42c.mp4


- It was stormy and windy and lots of tourists there, but Blue Lagoon is beautiful. ‚ú®

- Total driving time for Day 8 was **~1 hours (65 km)**.


### Day 8-9: Reykjav√≠k

- After I returned the camper, I took a taxi into Reykjav√≠k to stay and explore the tiny capital for a couple days.

![3E1202CD-A561-441B-BB2D-8B1988A52ADE 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/133317981-976f9919-824d-40fa-b061-ea85aa57d3e3.JPG)

- In the Keflavik airport as I was departing, I saw this quote ("I feel emotional landscapes, they puzzle me") from Bj√∂rk's song [J√≥ga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loB0kmz_0MM) on a window in the terminal and it's how I felt during the whole trip... a bit unable to articulate my feelings about this place. I never felt so deeply for things and places I was seeing for the first time but yet felt oddly familiar already and comfortable for me to be there. <3

## What's next?

I'm going back as soon as I can! Either in a couple months or in the spring to hopefully see the Northern Lights! I think about how great I felt there **every day** since I got back from the trip. My anxiety and self-doubt was at 0% during the trip, I felt confident and strong. üí™ It filled me with so much happiness to fall asleep & wake up in the camper everyday. üòä
