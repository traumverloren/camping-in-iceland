# My Guide to Solo Camping in Iceland üáÆüá∏

Doing a solo camping trip in Iceland is a brilliant idea if you are a person (especially a woman) that has been interested in tackling traveling or camping alone. Iceland is relatively safe & if you have a driver's license and not scared of driving on some gravel roads or one-lane bridges, it's a beautiful country to explore. ‚ú®

## Pre-trip planning:

### How did I choose a camper rental?


![A picnic spot on the Southeast coast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132061841-a5331e61-aafb-49d4-9bdb-8306ff2a2cfd.jpg)

Honestly, I didn't plan my trip planning to rent a camper van. I was thinking about staying in Reykjavik & take some tours out from there, then I decided I wanted to do the ring road around Iceland and looked at tour buses (ridiculously expensive), then getting a rental car & renting hotel rooms, then landed on getting a camper van since would probably be the most flexible option & honestly the most affordable for me traveling solo. 

I rented my camper from [Happy Campers](https://happycampers.is/) after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE1PQPCYbGg) of a woman solo camping in Iceland using their van. I felt like if it worked for her, it would work for me! There office is close to Keflavik International Airport & they offer a shuttle pickup from the airport every hour.

I ended up choosing their [Happiest bundle](https://happycampers.is/campers/extras/) at an extra 60 euros/day to have the full insurance (including gravel/rock damage) coverage (& complete peace of mind) & any of their extras I'd like for the camper. I ended up adding a bluetooth portable speaker (was a great idea!), camp chair, camp table, & an extra sleeping bag to my camper.

![My favorite gravel road, Route 54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/131900639-5db483dd-d396-4679-a518-59831edb6a88.jpg)
![Camping on the very north of Iceland](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/131902711-1fd1f8b1-abbf-430b-9ed4-cf8c52c4aa43.jpg)


Of course, I checked out other camper rentals, but felt the Happer Camper setup for the [smallest van (Happy 1 Auto)](https://happycampers.is/camper/happy-1-auto/) (built-in "kitchen" with sink & fridge, foldup bed/couch, usb ports in the back of the van, heater!) & that wifi/gps is included in the rental was a great deal. The final thing that won me over was that I could get it with an automatic transmission!

![Inside of camper with bed unfolded with ipad playing Downton Abbey](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132061988-5468662a-64fa-439b-b50e-e3a4f1c3227c.jpg)

It is advertised as a 1-2 person camper. If you are planning to rent a small camper van like this for 2 people, beware that it is going to be cozy sleeping together & limited storage for 2 people in the van. Make sure you like spending a lot of close time together beforehand üòÖ. I felt it was great for one person though. I spent my evenings drinking hot chocolate and watching downton abbey on my ipad in bed as shown above . üôÉ

As you can see in my video above, I really fell in love with this little VW Caddy. (I named him Karl the camper, btw) It was easy to drive and as long as I didn't go on too rough of a gravel road (some campsite roads are brutal üòÖ) the 2WD little chariot was a dream to drive & live in for a week!

### How did I plan my itinerary?

Honestly figuring out my route was my biggest stress going into the trip. I knew I wanted do a clockwise loop around the island and hit several geothermal baths & see cool land formations. I basically focused on main tourist sites in [this google map I created](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1YV8FF4ZWxXEUkmTUc94H3E1EFlFTJ6ov&usp=sharing) & then cross-referenced with these campsite google maps:

- [Happy Campers Campsite Guide](https://www.google.de/maps/@64.9072787,-21.9859533,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!6m1!1s1wk_t105qo4BYqaBL7xTcLUz5uXQ)
- [Campsite of Iceland](https://www.google.de/maps/@64.6605078,-24.8965918,5z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!6m1!1s1gJV0ZEEDYENMWKp4hvMoeEpDQycW9IHd)

I estimated I would be ok driving 4-5 hours a day to be able to complete the trip in 7 days and that's how I initially planned what campsites would stay at.

During the trip, I spent a lot of time checking the google reviews and photos of different campsites to make sure it felt like I would like the scenery & would hopefully not be too busy because they offerred many amenities (kitchen, showers, washing machines, etc). I actually ended up preferring the more primitive campsites that only offered toilets & perhaps an outdoor sink since they were less populated with families & kids.

### What did I pack?

I only packed a [Tom Bihn Aeronaut 45](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/travel-bags/products/aeronaut-45?variant=16037975719999) carry-on bag & my trusty Fj√§llr√§ven k√•nken backpack. I knew the camper would be light on storage for my large hardcase Rimowa checked luggage... But the real reason for carry-on only was that I was completely freaked out about the time it might take to get through the covid-19 checks at the Arrivals at Keflavik airport after reading this [article](https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2021/08/09/passengers_arriving_in_iceland_stuck_in_line_for_ho/). I was arriving at 14:30 & needed to pick up my camper by 16:30 & was concerned about making it out of the airport in time. So I planned for carry-on only & even paid & booked a first row seat on the plane. This turned out to be unnecessary as there was no line of course when I arrived. üôÉ

I knew the temps would be cool but not unbearable, especially since I love cooler weather, so it was not necessary for me to bring a lot of items for layering. Also, I'm ok with washing underwear and shirts in the sink and letting them dry to rewear in order to save luggage space.

**The most important non-clothing items I brought were my coffee making supplies! I'm a coffee enthusiast ‚òï & daydreamed heavily about the moment each morning where I would prepare an aeropress coffee in the camper üòç.**

#### Pack list:

  - Eyebrow powder
  - Mascara

In retrospect, I hesitated & didn't pack a couple items that I would NOT forget the next time. They were:

- Headlamp (for trips to bathroom in the night!)
- Nail glue (I have long beautiful natural nails, and the camping & hot bath soaks were brutal on my nails & I split a nail at end of the trip & paid heavily to find nail glue in a pharmacy to repair it!)
- Suncreen (for the sun in the northern part of the island!)
- AUX cable & iphone headphone adapter (The touchscreen of the infotainment system of the VW Caddy was unresponsive so I could not use BT to stream music & ended up driving all 7 days in silence üòß)

### How does camping work in Iceland?

It is extremely illegal to camp outside of a campground in Iceland. Do not do this!

No reason or real way to book ahead, there will be spots available. Fees ranged from free (donation encouraged) to 20 euros. Most I stayed at were around 8 euros/night. You basically pick a spot & that's it really. You either pay when you arrive at a reception area or if no one is there, someone will show up in the morning & knock on your camper. Everywhere accepted card/contactless payments. If you need to pay for a washing machine or shower, be prepared with some coins.

My camper van came with a large water reservoir container that was hooked up to the sink and functioned as my drinking water during the trip. Most campgrounds have an outdoor faucet with hose that you can use to refill your water reservoir.

### Day 1: Arrival

- Picked up the camper van
- Went to the nearest Kronan & bought groceries. I opted to mainly eat sandwiches during the trip to minimize how much different food I bought. I "splurged" on Honey Nut Cheerios & Swiss Miss hot cocoa as I miss this stuff from the US. The only thing I really cooked during the trip was eggs.

![IMG_3375](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132093302-c6f76302-3732-4412-9c1e-8ee80ef6ff0f.jpg)

- Drove **2 hours (143km)** to my first campground, [Snorrasta√∞ir Farm](https://snorrastadir.is/) in Borgarnes.

![IMG_3383](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132093315-c186b4c9-3db0-49a7-995a-9d403cdaf871.jpg)

- This campground was the priciest of the entire trip at ~20 euros. But, it had great facilities (Huge indoor kitchen/dining area, hot private showers) & I could pay at the reception upon arrival. It wasn't busy so it was a great first night camping experience.

### Day 2: Sn√¶fellsnes Peninsula

- Drove around the entire Sn√¶fellsnes Peninsula
- Stopped at [B√∫√∞akirkja](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/budakirkja), [Gatklettur](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/gatklettur), [Kirkjufellsfoss](https://guidetoiceland.is/connect-with-locals/regina/mt-kirkjufell-kirkjufellsfoss-in-grundarfjoerdur-the-most-popular-mountain-on-the-snaefellsnes-peninsula)

- Accidently drove past some beaches I wanted to stop at, but kept going forward.

- One of my favorite parts of the trip was taking **Rte 54** which is a rougher dirt road between the peninsula and Northwest Iceland. It loops around the fjords & is fairly desolate with very little traffic. It was marvelous. I stopped at a picnic pullover & watercolored in my travel journal for a while. It was windy, cool & moody. I love it.

- I drove to the [Illugastadir Campground](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/illugastadir-1) on the northwestern coast for Night 2. It is a seal viewing spot and the site has a dramatic backstory of jilted lovers stabbing & burning a man in the house on the site. The murderers were beheaded & their heads put on stakes. It was the last public execution in Iceland.

![IMG_3571](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132095763-c14452f5-8fdc-4445-aba4-aab9ee096fbb.jpg)

- It was a primitive (only 2 toilets & outdoor sink) and quiet campground with only a few other campers there overnight. There was no office to pay at, but a nice lady showed up in the morning at the main house & walked over to my camper in the morning so I could pay. This was my favorite campground of the entire trip and would 10000% go back to stay 1-2 more nights.

![IMG_3523](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9959680/132097369-5c3338a0-2552-4b65-b59f-8f8959ddede6.jpg)

- Total driving time for Day 2 was **5 hours (360 km)**.
